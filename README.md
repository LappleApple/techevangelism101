# So You Want to Hire a Tech Evangelist ...

Hi! I'm Lauri, and I'm here to help you with that. 

###Brief Intro
I got my start in tech evangelism at [Gilt Groupe](http://tech.gilt.com/) in NYC, after spending lots of years bumping around journalism, online media, law school, and PR. Working with an extremely savvy HR Director and anarchistically minded, empowering SVP Engineering, I created a job description that took all my disparate skills together and created a cohesive role. My charge was two-fold: A) brand Gilt as an innovative, challenging tech employer; B) build community internally, to retain our amazing (and I mean AMAZING) technologists. The role combined HR/recruitment, PR, community management (internal and external), sourcing, tech-blogging, social media, and random other topics relevant to goals A+B.

Over my two years as TE my role changed (think of a shape-shifting amoeba) as my confidence and knowledge increased. My favorite part of the job was working with our technologists to help them discover their superpowers as communicators, innovators and thought leaders. People like Gregory Mazurek, author of this [5 Reasons Why Your Company Needs To Hire A Tech Evangelist, Now](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-5-reasons-why-your-company-needs-hire-tech-now-gregory-mazurek) post, who was a former publishing guy turned front-end developer. Greg brought enthusiasm and humility to everything he did, which eventually involved leading teams. (These days he's a senior director of engineering at a different company.) With my assistance (but not much, as he knew what to do), he started giving tech talks and writing more blog posts. This helped our recruitment efforts: top tech talent want to work with people like Greg! So having Greg out there in public, connecting to audiences on behalf of Gilt, was a win-win.

In Feburary 2015, I hopped the pond and spent a year doing similar work at [Zalando](https://tech.zalando.com/), reporting into HR. These days, I focus on [open source](https://zalando.github.io/) evangelism/culture-building and agile coachy/producer-y stuff, reporting into tech. Meanwhile, Gilt hired a new tech evangelist. From what I've heard, he's great! 

This guide is meant to help you as you think about hiring a tech evangelist. It's structured so that, whether you're a tiny startup or a gigantic company, you can think about which aspects of TE you can and want to incorporate into your offerings, scale up, etc. 

If you're a tech evangelist yourself, please contribute to this doc! Let's get this party started ...

###Internal evangelism/culture-building
— Create biweekly tech newsletter highlighting news and upcoming events
— Work closely with team leads and managers to ID opportunities for specific teams and individuals to self-promote
— Work closely with team leads, HR, managers to ensure team evangelism efforts are acknowledged during performance review and/or even integrate them into list of job responsibilities
— Survey team on regular (monthly or quarterly) basis to take the temperature on certain initiatives and developments
— Organize team tech talks featuring outside industry leaders
— Create a plan for team activities: outings, contests, talent shows, team quizzes and games
— Acknowledge new hires with desk decorations, monthly meet-the-newbies lunch (would organize a welcoming committee to strategize around this)
 
###External evangelism/employer branding
— Tech Blog: technical posts, upcoming public appearances, reporting on health-related OS projects

###Open Source Evangelism
— Open Source: work with engineering team to create streamlined process for project development, release and marketing (hopefully decentralized)
— Choose appropriate licensing
 Work with creative to develop logos for major projects
 Edit documentation
Promote projects in tech community, to related media (e-newsletters, DZone, etc.)
o   Social media: Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube
o   B2B outreach: seek case-study coverage from companies whose products we use (possible examples: Atlassian, Optimizely, Looker)
o   Media outreach: promote tech team/achievements to tech media
o   Scholarship-related outreach: contact healthcare tech authors, startup/business authors, academics, tech freelance writers to pitch them stories about work culture, data, company culture/history, tech team organization/ideology
o   Industry outreach: promote team work to relevant industry leaders and, when possible, make introductions
o   Meetups: produce high-quality technical events of interest to own team as well as peers
 Inform team of upcoming meetups of interest (through “evangelism” group chat room)
o   Conferences: monitor Lanyrd.com, Twitter and other popular tech event info sources to prospect for opportunities for team to promote their work
o   Edit tech team members’ conference proposals, bios, presentations, blog posts, articles, any other materials; write and brainstorm topics when necessary
 
###Tech skills/professional development
o   Tech courses open to the community, w/subjects chosen based on team interests
o   Work with team leads to develop own courses, taught by own team (courses can be taught to public but are also very useful for onboarding)
 Ideally offer this content to Coursera, Skillshare, or other online learning platforms to promote tech brand externally
o   Work with team leads to ID skills blind spots and organize learning sessions to address those areas
o   Create in-house open source retreat (1-2 weeks) initiatives for engineers working on OS projects
 
Public policy-related evangelism
o   Outreach to relevant advocates, educators, nonprofits, and other entities to form strategic partnerships and alliances
o   Stay up-to-date on industry trends and legislative developments relevant to company’s interest/mission
o   Create one-pagers and reports if needed
o   Represent the company at relevant policy discussions, legislative hearings, lobbying days, press conferences
o   Write op-eds stating company position
o   Work with legal team to drive policy-related initiatives company engages in—direct cross-functional team (marketing, creative, tech, legal)
o   Work with legal team to develop a quarterly/annual plan for engagement
o   Work with creative team to create infographics and visuals related to company goals
 
Company-wide evangelism
o   Work with social media/communications, PR and marketing team to ensure messaging is consistent across organization
o   Collaborate with other teams to share tips on new social media/outreach tools, brainstorm social media campaign ideas, ID opportunities for outreach
o   Manage PR campaigns if necessary
 
Recruitment-related 
o   Help streamline recruitment process: tech screen; candidate correspondence; onsite interviews; post-interview correspondence
o   Help recruiting form Recruiting Committee made up of tech team members who are interested in process
o   Research recruiting best practices and new trends and share research with others
o   Help standardize recruitment messaging in job descriptions, ads (Hired, StackOverflow, etc.) and ensure language is clear, human
o   Support recruiting team’s long-term efforts to launch internship program, attend campus/career fairs (support = research opportunities, help assemble plan of action, help draft/choose/create swag/signage & booth design/collateral)
o   Help develop referral program with rewards and events to celebrate milestones/achievements
o   Help recruiting team create innovative strategies to spread the word about our job opportunities (videos, social media campaigns, visuals)
 
Resource needs
o   Advance buy-in among tech execs and leads—ie is an evangelist something the team really believes it needs?
o   Budget to cover activities and related expenses
o   Staffing: I strongly suggest hiring a coordinator to handle logistics and admin tasks related to internal and external evangelism activities; this coordinator could also help recruiting and marketing teams (work cross-departmentally)
o   Clarity on where this role fits within the organization – who does the evangelist report to?
o   Clarity on the career trajectory – how is success in role/effectiveness measured? How do we gauge differences between “evangelist” and “senior evangelist,” “director of evangelism,” et al?
