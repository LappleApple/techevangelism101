# So You Want to Hire a Tech Evangelist ...

Hi! I'm Lauri, and I'm here to help you with that. 

###Brief Intro
I got my start in tech evangelism at [Gilt Groupe](http://tech.gilt.com/) in NYC, after spending lots of years bumping around journalism, online media, law school, and PR. Working with an extremely savvy HR Director and anarchistically minded, empowering SVP Engineering, I created a job description that took all my disparate skills together and created a cohesive role. My charge was two-fold: A) brand Gilt as an innovative, challenging tech employer; B) build community internally, to retain our amazing (and I mean AMAZING) technologists. The role combined HR/recruitment, PR, community management (internal and external), sourcing, tech-blogging, social media, and random other topics relevant to goals A+B.

Over my two years as TE my role changed (think of a shape-shifting amoeba) as my confidence and knowledge increased. My favorite part of the job was working with our technologists to help them discover their superpowers as communicators, innovators and thought leaders. People like Gregory Mazurek, author of this [5 Reasons Why Your Company Needs To Hire A Tech Evangelist, Now](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-5-reasons-why-your-company-needs-hire-tech-now-gregory-mazurek) post, who was a former publishing guy turned front-end developer. Greg brought enthusiasm and humility to everything he did, which eventually involved leading teams. (These days he's a senior director of engineering at a different company.) With my assistance (but not much, as he knew what to do), he started giving tech talks and writing more blog posts. This helped our recruitment efforts: top tech talent want to work with people like Greg! So having Greg out there in public, connecting to audiences on behalf of Gilt, was a win-win.

In Feburary 2015, I hopped the pond and spent a year doing similar work at [Zalando](https://tech.zalando.com/), reporting into HR. These days, I focus on [open source](https://zalando.github.io/) evangelism/culture-building and agile coachy/producer-y stuff, reporting into tech. Meanwhile, Gilt hired a new tech evangelist. From what I've heard, he's great! 

This guide is meant to help you as you think about hiring a tech evangelist. It's structured so that, whether you're a tiny startup or a gigantic company, you can think about which aspects of TE you can and want to incorporate into your offerings, scale up, etc. 

If you're a tech evangelist yourself, please contribute to this doc! Let's get this party started ...

###Before You Hire
You'll need to think about a few key ingredients upfront.

####Can You Actually Hire Someone?
- Advance buy-in among tech execs and leads—ie is an evangelist something the team really believes it needs?
- Budget to cover activities and related expenses
- Clarity on where this role fits within the organization – who does the evangelist report to?
- Clarity on the career trajectory – how is success in role/effectiveness measured? How do we gauge differences between “evangelist” and “senior evangelist,” “director of evangelism,” et al?

####If your goal is hiring tech talent
- What are your short- and long-term hiring goals? 
- What is your recruitment infrastructure? Do you have a sourcer? Do you plan on this person doing sourcing and follow-up (candidate research, outreach, reviewing applications for fit, etc.)? I strongly suggest hiring a coordinator to handle logistics and admin tasks related to internal and external evangelism activities; this coordinator could also help recruiting and marketing teams (work cross-departmentally).

###Internal evangelism/culture-building
— Create biweekly tech newsletter highlighting news and upcoming events
— Work closely with team leads and managers to ID opportunities for specific teams and individuals to self-promote
— Work closely with team leads, HR, managers to ensure team evangelism efforts are acknowledged during performance review and/or even integrate them into list of job responsibilities
— Survey team on regular (monthly or quarterly) basis to take the temperature on certain initiatives and developments
— Organize team tech talks featuring outside industry leaders
— Create a plan for team activities: outings, contests, talent shows, team quizzes and games
— Acknowledge new hires with desk decorations, monthly meet-the-newbies lunch (would organize a welcoming committee to strategize around this)
 
###Blogging and Social Media
— Create, write for, edit, and promote a tech blog. You want a nice combination of technical posts, reviews of your team's meetup and conference experiences (keep the focus on substance), reporting on OS projects your team is working on, Q&A's with your team about different aspects of your culture, think pieces by your execs and technologists about industry trends ... and more. Be creative.
— Ensure a diversity of voices. 
- Tag appropriately and run your tech blog to make it easy to search by subject matter. Your UX audience is not going to read that post about load balancing; make sure they can find the relevant stuff.

###Open Source Evangelism
For a comprehensive how-to on open-source evangelism, [click here](https://github.com/zalando/zalando-howto-open-source). 
— Open Source: work with engineering team to create streamlined process for project development, release and marketing (hopefully decentralized)
— Choose appropriate licensing
- Work with creative to develop logos for projects
- Edit documentation
- Promote projects in tech community, to related media (e-newsletters, DZone, etc.)
- Community-manage: respond to PRs and Issues to ensure your team is responding/being responsible project stewards, thank people for their contributions, etc. 
— Create in-house open source retreat (1-2 weeks) initiatives for engineers working on OS projects. Call it the FOSSpital. 

###Social media: Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube
— B2B outreach: seek case-study coverage from companies whose products we use (possible examples: Atlassian, Optimizely, Looker)
— Media outreach: promote tech team/achievements to tech media
o   Scholarship-related outreach: contact healthcare tech authors, startup/business authors, academics, tech freelance writers to pitch them stories about work culture, data, company culture/history, tech team organization/ideology
— Industry outreach: promote team work to relevant industry leaders using social media and, when possible, make introductions

###Meetups and Conferences
— Meetups: produce high-quality technical events of interest to own team as well as peers
— Inform team of upcoming meetups of interest (through “evangelism” HipChat room or Slack channel)
— Conferences: monitor Lanyrd.com, Twitter and other popular tech event info sources to prospect for opportunities for team to promote their work
— Edit tech team members’ conference proposals, bios, presentations, blog posts, articles, any other materials; write and brainstorm topics when necessary
 
###Tech skills/professional development
- Host tech courses open to the community, w/subjects chosen based on team interests. This way, your team learns essential new skills, and others in the community also benefit. 
- Work with team leads to develop your own courses, taught by own team (courses can be taught to public but are also very useful for onboarding)
— Ideally offer this content on online learning platforms to promote tech brand externally
— Work with team leads to ID skills blind spots and organize learning sessions to address those areas
 
###Public policy-related evangelism
— Outreach to relevant advocates, educators, nonprofits, and other entities to form strategic partnerships and alliances
— Stay up-to-date on industry trends and legislative developments relevant to company’s interest/mission
— Create one-pagers and reports on your team's cutting-edge work/research
— Represent the company at relevant policy discussions, legislative hearings, lobbying days, press conferences
— Write op-eds stating company position
— Work with legal team to drive policy-related initiatives company engages in—direct cross-functional team (marketing, creative, tech, legal)
— Work with legal team to develop a quarterly/annual plan for engagement
— Work with creative team to create infographics and visuals related to company goals
 
###Company-wide evangelism
— Work with social media/communications, PR and marketing team to ensure messaging is consistent across organization
— Collaborate with non-tech teams to share tips on new social media/outreach tools, brainstorm social media campaign ideas, ID opportunities for outreach
- Manage/co-manage PR campaigns if necessary
 
###Recruitment-related 
— Help streamline recruitment process: tech screen; candidate correspondence; onsite interviews; post-interview correspondence
- Help recruiting form Recruiting Committee made up of tech team members who are interested in process
- Research recruiting best practices and new trends and share research with others
- Help standardize recruitment messaging in job descriptions, ads (Hired, StackOverflow, etc.) and ensure language is clear, human
- Support recruiting team’s long-term efforts to launch internship program, attend campus/career fairs (support = research opportunities, help assemble plan of action, help draft/choose/create swag/signage & booth design/collateral)
- Help develop referral program with rewards and events to celebrate milestones/achievements
- Help recruiting team create innovative strategies to spread the word about our job opportunities (videos, social media campaigns, visuals)
